Welcome to Rustify! ðŸ¦€

Rustify is a template for kickstarting your Rust projects.
Whether you're a seasoned Rustacean or just getting started with the language, Rustify provides a solid foundation for building reliable and efficient software in Rust.

## Features

- **Cargo Integration**: Rustify leverages Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system, to manage dependencies and build your project.
- **Configured for Common Tools**: This template comes pre-configured with common tools and configurations such as Gitignore, Cargo.toml, and a basic project structure to save you time.
- **Testing Framework Included**: Rustify includes a testing framework setup, so you can start writing tests for your code right away.
- **Documentation Setup**: Rustify encourages documentation with a pre-configured setup for Rust's documentation generator, Rustdoc.
- **License**: A pre-configured Apache License file is included, allowing you to easily choose an open-source license for your project.

## Getting Started

To use Rustify to start a new project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/gvatsal60/rustify.git`.
2. Rename the directory to your project name: `mv rustify your-project-name`.
3. Navigate into your project directory: `cd your-project-name`.
4. Start coding! ðŸš€

## Note: rustify folder name should be same as the root folder name else change the PROJECT_NAME variable
